# OpeNote

An alternative student management system.

## Requirements

1. docker
2. docker-compose

## Installation

First, clone this repository along with its submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-du-bled/openote --recursive
```

Then, deploy it using compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Logging in
Congrats, you just deployed your first openote instance !!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
To start your incredible school admin journey, we prepared an admin account for you !! Try to log in as `admin@example.com` with password `password` !!

> [!CAUTION]
> For security reasons, you **should** change the email and password of this default admin account.

## Setting up debug entries

By default, OpeNote only includes a default admin user, which isn't ideal for development purposes. As such, you can add debug entries using the follow commands

```bash
cd back
./scripts/setup_debug_entries.sh
```

Here is the list of premade users you can log in as :

```
student1@example.com : password
student2@example.com : password
teacher@example.com : password
admin@example.com : password
```

## Resetting the database
All data is stored in the accordingly named folder : `data`

Resetting the database is as simple as
- tearing down the stack with docker compose: `docker compose down`
- deleting the data folder: `rm -rf data` (this might require sudo depending on the runtime used or user)
- deploying it again: `docker compose up -d`

> [!CAUTION]
> This **cannot be undone**. **BE CAREFULL**
